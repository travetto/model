travetto: Model
===

This module provides a clean interface to data model persistence, modification and retrieval.  This module builds heavily upon the [`Schema`](https://github.com/travetto/schema), which is used for data model validation.

The module can be segmented into three main areas: Model declaration, access/storage, and querying

## Declaration
Models are declared via the `@Model` decorator, which allows the system to know that this is a class that is compatible with the
module.

```typescript
@Model()
class User extends BaseModel {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  contact?: boolean;
}
```

The `User` model is now ready to be used with the model services.

## Access/Storage
The [`ModelService`](./src/service/model.ts) is the foundation for all access to the storage layer, and provides a comprehensive set of functionality.  The service includes support for modifying individual records, bulk update/insert/delete, partial updates, finding records, and more.  This should be the expected set of functionality for storage and retrieval.

```typescript
class UserManager {
  private service: ModelService;

  async register(user: User) {
    const created = await this.service.save(User, user);
    ... send welcome email ...
    return created;
  }

  async bulkCreate(users: User[]) {
    const res = await this.service.bulkProcess(User, {
      insert: users
    });
    ... notify administrator of completion ...
    return res; 
  }
}

```

The [`ModelService`](./src/service/model.ts) itself relies upon a [`ModelSource`](./src/service/source.ts) which is the driver for the storage layer. Currently the only `ModelSource` implementations are for [`mongodb`](https://mongodb.com) and [`elasticsearch`](https://elastic.co), with sql support on the roadmap.

During development, `ModelSource` supports the ability to respond to model changes in real-time, and to modify the underlying storage mechanism.  An example of this would be `elasticsearch` schemas being updated as fields are added or removed from the `Model` class.

Additionally there is a class [`ClassModelService`](./src/service/class-model.ts) that provides a wrapper around `ModelService` that is tied to a specific `Model` class.  This can be useful if you want to constrain the model access or if you have a high volume of function calls for the same model.

## Querying
One of the complexities of abstracting multiple storage mechanisms, is providing a consistent query language.  The query language the module uses is a derivation of `mongodb`'s query language, with some restrictions, additions, and caveats.

### General Fields
* ```field : { $eq : T }``` to determine if a field is equal to a value
* ```field : { $ne: T }``` to determine if a field is not equal to a value
* ```field : { $exists : boolean }``` to determine if a field exists or not
* ```field : T``` to see if the field is equal to whatever value is passed in

### General Single Valued Fields
* ```field : { $in : T[] }``` to see if a record's value appears in the array provided to `$in`
* ```field : { $nin: T[] }``` to see if a record's value does not appear in the array provided to `$in`

### Ordered Fields
* ```field : { $lt: T }``` checks if value is less than
* ```field : { $lte: T }``` checks if value is less than or equal to
* ```field : { $gt: T }``` checks if value is greater than
* ```field : { $gte : T }``` checks if value is greater than or equal to

### Array Fields
* ```field : { $all: T[]] }``` checks to see if the records value contains everything within `$all`

### String Fields
* ```field : { $regex: RegExp; }``` checks the field against the regular expresesion

### Geo Point Fields
* ```field : { $geoWithin: Point[] }``` determines if the value is within the bounding region of the points
* ```field : { $geoIntersects: Point[] }``` determines if the value intersects with the bounding region of the points

### Groupings
* ```{ $and: [] }``` provides a grouping in which all sub clauses are required
* ```{ $or: [] }``` provides a grouping in which at least one of the sub clauses is required
* ```{ $not : {} }``` negates a clause

A sample query for `User`s might be:
```typescript
this.service.getAllByQuery(User, {
  $and: [
    { 
      $not : {
        age : {
          $lt : 35
        }
      }
    },
    {
      contact : {
        $exists: true
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

This would find all users who are over 35 and that have the `contact` field specified.
